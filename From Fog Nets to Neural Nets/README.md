## Prediction Challenge: From weather to water

For landlocked, indigenous Berber communities in Southwest Morocco, fresh water is usually scarce. Look to the sky, though, and you’ll find abundant fog draping the area 6 months/year. Fog collection is an ancient system to collect clean water in a noninvasive, ecologically friendly way in regions where fog abounds. Dar Si Hmad (DSH) has built the world’s largest fogcollection and distribution system to serve these indigenous communities. Delivery of fogwater significantly reduces women’s laborious water gathering chores, and helps foster stable communities, continuation of ancestral languages and ways of living in thriving local environments.
Your challenge is to develop a model that will predict the yield of DSH’s fog nets for every day during an evaluation period, using historical data about meteorological conditions and the fog net installations. Accurate predictions will enable DSH to operate more effectively and the communities it serves to be have greater access to fresh water throughout the year.
