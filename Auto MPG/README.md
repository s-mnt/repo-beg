## Aim

The aim of this project is to predict the mpg (miles per gallon) of the vehicles using the data collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG).


## Introduction

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library in line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original". The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.
