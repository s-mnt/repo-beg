## Aim

The goal of this project is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia in the subjects tested upon, using the data collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia)

This database contains 279 attributes, 206 of which are linear valued and the rest are nominal. The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia in the patients. The names and id numbers of the patients were removed from the database.
